# Information sources for further steps of the project

## Interfacing Android with Teensy through USB-Host
* This will be an alternative communication method in case bluetooth module can not switch between HID and SPP without losing pairing.


## How to save data into permanent memory on Arduino flash storage
* This will be needed for 2 cases; saving paired device and also input command pairs.

## Find inspiration for easy mechanical clip-on solutions for modules
* This clip-on design solution will be used to attach modules onto the main hub.
